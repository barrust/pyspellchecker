Quickstart
===============================================================================

``pyspellchecker`` is designed to be easy to use to get basic spell checking.

Installation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The best experience is likely to use ``pip``:

.. code:: bash

    pip install pyspellchecker

If you are using virtual environments, it is recommended to use ``pipenv`` to
combine pip and virtual environments:

.. code:: bash

    pipenv install pyspellchecker

Basic Usage
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Setting up the spell checker requires importing and initializing the instance.

.. code:: python

    from spellchecker import SpellChecker

    spell = SpellChecker()


There are several methods to determine if a word is in the word frequency list:

.. code:: python

    from spellchecker import SpellChecker

    spell = SpellChecker()
    spell['morning']  # True
    'morning' in spell  # True

    # find those words from a list of words that are found in the dictionary
    spell.known(['morning', 'hapenning'])  # {'morning'}

    # find those words from a list of words that are not found in the dictionary
    spell.unknown(['morning', 'hapenning'])  # {'hapenning'}


Once a word is identified as misspelled, you can find the likeliest replacement:

.. code:: python

    from spellchecker import SpellChecker

    spell = SpellChecker()

    misspelled = spell.unknown(['morning', 'hapenning'])  # {'hapenning'}
    for word in misspelled:
        spell.correction(word)  # 'happening'


If using a set of long words that is taking a long time to process corrections
then the Levenshtein distance can be set to 1. The default, is 2.

.. code:: python

    from spellchecker import SpellChecker

    spell = SpellChecker(distance=1)  # set the Levenshtein Distance parameter

    # do additional work

    # now for shorter words, we can revert to Levenshtein Distance of 2!
    spell.distance = 2


Or if the word identified as the likeliest is not correct, a list of candidates
can also be pulled:

.. code:: python

    from spellchecker import SpellChecker

    spell = SpellChecker()

    misspelled = spell.unknown(['morning', 'hapenning'])  # {'hapenning'}
    for word in misspelled:
        spell.correction(word)  # {'penning', 'happening', 'henning'}


Changing Language
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To set the language of the dictionary to load, one must set the language
parameter on initialization.

.. code:: python

    from spellchecker import SpellChecker

    spell = SpellChecker(language='es')  # Spanish dictionary
    print(spell['ma√±ana'])


Multiple Languages
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you would like to check multiple default languages, it is possible to pass a
list of language identifiers to the constructor to load each:

.. code:: python
    from spellchecker import SpellChecker

    spell = SpellChecker(language=['es', 'en'])


Adding and Removing Terms from a Dictionary
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are several ways to add additional terms to your word frequency dictionary
including by filepath, string of text, or by a list of words.


To load a pre-defined dictionary file (either as a json file or a gzipped json
file):

.. code:: python

    from spellchecker import SpellChecker

    spell = SpellChecker()
    spell.word_frequency.load_dictionary('./path-to-my-word-frequency.json')


To load a text document that will be parsed into individual words and each word
added to the frequency list:

.. code:: python

    from spellchecker import SpellChecker

    spell = SpellChecker()
    spell.word_frequency.load_text_file('./path-to-my-text-doc.txt')


To load plain text from input or another source:

.. code:: python

    from spellchecker import SpellChecker

    spell = SpellChecker()
    spell.word_frequency.load_text('Text to be parsed and added to the system')


Or update using a list of words:

.. code:: python

    from spellchecker import SpellChecker

    spell = SpellChecker()
    spell.word_frequency.load_words(['Text', 'to', 'be','added', 'to', 'the', 'system'])


Or add a single word:

.. code:: python

    from spellchecker import SpellChecker

    spell = SpellChecker()
    spell.word_frequency.add('Text')


Removing words is as simple as adding words:

.. code:: python

    from spellchecker import SpellChecker

    spell = SpellChecker()
    spell.word_frequency.remove_words(['Text', 'to', 'be','removed', 'from', 'the', 'system'])

    # or remove a single word
    spell.word_frequency.remove('meh')

Iterating Over a Dictionary
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Iterating over the dictionary is as easy as writing a simple for loop:

.. code:: python

    from spellchecker import SpellChecker

    spell = SpellChecker()

    for word in spell:
        print("{}: {}".format(word, spell[word]))

The iterator returns the word. To get the number of times that the word is
found in the WordFrequency object one can use a simple lookup.


How to Build a New Dictionary
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Building a custom or new language dictionary is relatively straight forward. To
begin, you will need to have either a word frequency list or text files that
represent the usage of the terms. Since ``pyspellchecker`` uses word frequency, it
is better to have the most common words have higher frequencies!

Once you have the corpus, code similar to the following should build out the
dictionary:

.. code:: python

    from spellchecker import SpellChecker

    # turn off loading a built language dictionary, case sensitive on (if desired)
    spell = SpellChecker(language=None, case_sensitive=True)

    # if you have a dictionary...
    spell.word_frequency.load_dictionary('./path-to-my-json-dictionary.json')

    # or... if you have text
    spell.word_frequency.load_text_file('./path-to-my-text-doc.txt')

    # export it out for later use!
    spell.export('my_custom_dictionary.gz', gzipped=True)

It is also possible to build a dictionary from other sources outside of
``pyspellchecker``, it requires that the data be in the following format and
saved as a json object:

.. code:: python

    {
        "a": 1,
        "b": 2,
        "apple": 45,
        "bike": 60
    }

Note that the data does not need to be sorted!


A quick, command line spell checking program
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Setting up a quick and easy command line program using ``pyspellchecker`` is
straight forward:

.. code:: python

    from spellchecker import SpellChecker

    # could add command line arguments to set the parameters of the spell
    # check class; setup what type of information to present back, etc.
    spell = SpellChecker()

    print("To exit, hit return without input!")
    while True:
        word = input('Input a word to spell check: ')
        if word == '':  # not sure, but need a way to kill the program...
            break
        word = word.lower()
        if word in spell:
            print("'{}' is spelled correctly!".format(word))
        else:
            cor = spell.correction(word)
            print("The best spelling for '{}' is '{}'".format(word, cor))

            print("If that is not enough; here are all possible candidate words:")
            print(spell.candidates(word))


Using with PyInstaller
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It is possible to use ``pyspellchecker`` with tools such as PyInstaller to add
spell-checking to your executable program. To do so, you will need to add the
required dictionaries to the executable.

You will need to add the files to a folder in your executable called **spellchecker/resources/**
to match the location that ``pyspellchecker`` checks for the supported dictionaries.

.. code:: bash

    pyinstaller --add-binary="spellchecker/resources/en.json.gz:spellchecker/resources" my_prog.py
    
On windows one should use a semi-colon instead of the colon:

.. code:: bash

    pyinstaller --add-binary="spellchecker/resources/en.json.gz;spellchecker/resources" my_prog.py
